# shit to do

- Review and restructure config
- document, document, document
- make all of the file storage functions more modular (temp area, locally served, gstore served)
- make pushes to gstore happen less frequently than with each image capture
- move config options used in pushtoyoutube to another level
- more work on video_dispatcher
- make web page js, instead of cgi
- add code for capturing when the moon is in frame
- rewrite in python :)
